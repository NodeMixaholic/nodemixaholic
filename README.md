# So long. ðŸ‘‹
This GitHub user is no longer in use except for business purpouses.

## Please use this instead

```bash
git clone git://nodemixaholic.com/repoName
```

Replace repoName with listed repo name.

You can find a limited shell here to list contents: ```ssh git@nodemixaholic.com -p 69```

pass: ```imnorobot```


## Note

You may have to set the git property "receive.denyCurrentBranch" to ignore for each repo. TLDR: once cloned, go into the repo's folder and enter this:

```bash
git config --add receive.denyCurrentBranch ignore
```

OR, to do it globally just do this (HACKY AND NOT RECOMMENDED!!!):

```bash
git config --global --add receive.denyCurrentBranch ignore
```
